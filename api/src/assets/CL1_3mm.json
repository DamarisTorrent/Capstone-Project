But truly great wetsuits are made of the best neoprene. The higher the quality, the lighter, warmer and more flexible your wetsuit will be. Echo Stretch-Flight is made using eco-friendly limestone for increased warmth and comfort without sacrificing flexibility.\n\n\n\n\nGBS Seams\nSeams are the core structure of a wetsuit: they determine the strength, flexibility and water tightness of its construction. Triple glued and single-blind stitched seams are darned to partially penetrate the neoprene to reduce water entry.\n\n\n\n\nWarmth Technology - Lining\nRoxy's internal lining adds warmth without impacting your range of movement. Eco Sleek WarmFlight is a silky-smooth, lightweight lining with high quality warmth. Roxy's revolutionary lining technology keeps you warm in unmatched comfort. The lightweight material insulates and repels water for added warmth, flexibility and a faster drying time. 50% of the lining is made using fibers from recycled matter and 50% of the materials are dope-dyed meaning less water, less energy & fewer chemicals are used.\n\n\n\n\nDesign Technology\nLocking systems, seals and other thoughtfully considered design elements that make life in the water easy. A glide neck seal is an ultra-smooth neoprene liner for comfort and a watertight seal. The Supratex knee pad is a durable, lightweight and flexible outer knee pad that protects you and your board.\n\n\n\n\nEntry System\nConvenience, performance or a mix of both. No matter what your taste, we’ve got you covered. The back zip is a free floating zipper technology that will keep you dry. Easy to get into and effortless to get out of.\n\n\n\n\nSustainability\nRoxy considers the use of recycled and naturally sourced materials, water input, energy usage and eco-toxicity in each design choice.

The Hyperfreak has been one of O’Neill’s best-selling wetsuits for years and is now offered in the Fire addition. This could be arguably the best wetsuit ever created with the new lining. The extreme warmth, high performance, and increased durability of the Hyperfreak Fire come from O’Neill’s Technobutter 4 neoprene and watertight fluid seams.

O’Neill worked with their key manufacturing partner to develop a non-solvent based lamination glue called “aqua-alpha”. Aqua alpha reduces solvent usage by 600 grams per wetsuit compared to traditional laminating glues. Eliminates harmful VOCs and has the same durability as conventional, solvent-based Wetsuit glues. From recycled polybags to 100% recycled paper and soy based inks hang tags. Conserving water, energy and virgin materials. 100% digital catalogs. Dope-dying infusion produces colored yarns without the dyeing process. This saves tremendous amounts of water while reducing energy consumption and water pollution (up to 80%). 26% carbon emission is reduced for every kg of fabric. Every blueprint full suit saves more than 1 lb/0.5 kg of harmful plastic from potentially polluting the world’s living oceans. Carbon black is one of the key ingredients in neoprene. It can now be carbonized from scrap rubber tires using high heat to extract. 72% carbon emission declined. O’Neill’s advanced repair facility prolongs the life cycle of their product, keeping their wetsuit out of the landfill longer.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT CONSTRUCTION\n\nTB4 AIR FIREWALL\nThe next great thermal breakthrough was made better with trapped pockets of air. TB4 Air Firewall uses a special lamination process paired with a core of aerated neoprene and a graphene fiber jersey to create the toastiest conditions. Take summer with you.\n\nTB4 FIREWALL\nThe all new Technobutter 4 Firewall utilizes the recycled graphene fibers at a thicker pile to create a fire hot feedback loop. As the body heat warms the graphene fibers they conduct the heat back into the body.\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 4X\nTechnobutter 4x goes beyond the gooey stretch, and soft feel of TB3x. Recycled graphene fibers line the jersey allowing for incredible stretch with added strength and warmth retention, all with a new look.\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 4\nTB4 builds on the legendary Technobutter 3, the next evolution of the jersey introduces recycled yarns infused with graphene for increased wear strength and heat retention.\n\nMANUFACTURER’S DESCRIPTION\n\nThe O'Neill Hyperfreak Fire range focuses on extreme warmth, high performance, increased durability, and comfort. All-new sustainable, buttery soft, heat recirculating TechnoButter 4 materials line each suit. These technologically advanced materials plus water-tight Fluid Seam construction have created a new cold water legend.

O’Neill worked with their key manufacturing partner to develop a non-solvent based lamination glue called “aqua-alpha”. Aqua alpha reduces solvent usage by 600 grams per wetsuit compared to traditional laminating glues. Eliminates harmful VOCs and has the same durability as conventional, solvent-based Wetsuit glues. From recycled polybags to 100% recycled paper and soy based inks hang tags. Conserving water, energy and virgin materials. 100% digital catalogs. Dope-dying infusion produces colored yarns without the dyeing process. This saves tremendous amounts of water while reducing energy consumption and water pollution (up to 80%). 26% carbon emission is reduced for every kg of fabric. Every blueprint full suit saves more than 1 lb/0.5 kg of harmful plastic from potentially polluting the world’s living oceans. Carbon black is one of the key ingredients in neoprene. It can now be carbonized from scrap rubber tires using high heat to extract. 72% carbon emission declined. These products are made of Bluesign® approved fabrics and produced in a resource conserving way with a minimum impact on people and the environment. O’Neill’s advanced repair facility prolongs the life cycle of their product, keeping their wetsuit out of the landfill longer.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT CONSTRUCTION\n\nTB4 AIR FIREWALL\nThe next great thermal breakthrough was made better with trapped pockets of air. TB4 Air Firewall uses a special lamination process paired with a core of aerated neoprene and a graphene fiber jersey to create the toastiest conditions. Take summer with you.\n\nTB4 FIREWALL\nThe all new Technobutter 4 Firewall utilizes the recycled graphene fibers at a thicker pile to create a fire hot feedback loop. As the body heat warms the graphene fibers they conduct the heat back into the body.\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 4X\nTechnobutter 4x goes beyond the gooey stretch, and soft feel of TB3x. Recycled graphene fibers line the jersey allowing for incredible stretch with added strength and warmth retention, all with a new look.\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 4\nTB4 builds on the legendary Technobutter 3, the next evolution of the jersey introduces recycled yarns infused with graphene for increased wear strength and heat retention.\n\nF.U.Z.E. ZIP CLOSURE\nFront Upper Zip Entry (chest) uses a free floating zipper panel and anti flush barrier with drain holes to keep you dry and feeling loose.\n\nRECYCLED TBX FULLY TAPED / GBS SEAMS\nThe lightest, stretchiest neoprene seam tape ever. 0.5mm split-neoprene applied to triple-glued seams with water-based glue to keep you dry and loose. Blind stitched and triple glued to create a watertight seam, for increased durability while allowing the maximum stretch possible in a sealed seam.\n\nMANUFACTURER’S DESCRIPTION\n\nThe O'Neill Blueprint range offers mind-boggling minimal seams, flexibility, and warmth. The legacy of innovation continues with the latest exclusive eco-friendly TB4 materials and their most minimalistic panel design yet. The Blueprint uses the ultra-warm and stretchy TechnoButter 4 Firewall to introduce full coverage, including arms, body, and low legs.
