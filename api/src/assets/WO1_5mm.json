This suit is constructed with our renowned 100% M-Flex 2.0 neoprene. A high-quality neoprene with superb stretch. All seams are glued blind stitched and have critical taping added to the most vulnerable seams around the waist.\n\nTHE DETAILS:\nWaterproof stretch taping (50%): critical areas - A neoprene taping is positioned on the critical seams of the suit. This prevents water from coming through the seams on critical points of the human body.\nGBS (Glued Blind Stitch) - Stitching method whereby the panels are first glued together and then only stitched halfway through the fabric instead of fully perforating it, which makes the seams waterproof.\nYKK Front-zip - With a horizontal zipper on the chest, wetsuits with a Double Front-zip open from the top. This construction allows for an easier entry. Front-zip suits have more stretch in the back panel which gives you a lot more freedom of movement.\nAquabarrier - Aquabarrier is a silicone printing on the collarbone region of your wetsuit. This forms a barrier between the overlapping front-zip panels preventing water from entering.\nShin protection - Taking a rail to the shins isn't fun, but having EVA padding in our Shin Protection lowers the impact of your board by a ton.\nVelcro ankle closure straps (included)\nKey pocket 2.0: keyloop with mini buckle - An external neoprene key pocket conveniently positioned on the lower leg of the suit. The standard key loop is now equipped with a mini-buckle to release your key with ease while making sure your key is safe inside.\nAquaflush - Wipe out or simply needed to take a leak? The perforated neoprene patches on the lower leg, that we like to call Aquaflush, will ensure that all liquids exit the suit easily.\nMATERIALS:\n\nM-Flex (100%) - Now you've decided you're getting a kick out of the cold and wind, why not upgrade to M-Flex 100%? It'll keep you warm and also provides more stretch. Get ready for your next step and prepare well for the conditions you're about to face.\nFox fleece in chest, back and lower body - Big loops in the fabric create a high pile lining that holds air for extra insulation. It holds less water enhancing the fast-drying abilities of the fabric. With its superior stretch performance in all directions it’s super suitable for every panel in all of our suit.",

Chest-zip suits have more stretch in the back panel which gives you a lot more freedom of movement.\n\nAquabarrier - This is a silicone printing on the collarbone region of your wetsuit. This forms a barrier between the overlapping chest-zip panels preventing water from entering.\n\nAquaflush 2.0 - This new and improved neoprene structure will only allow water to go out of your wetsuit and doesn't seep in from the outside through the same holes anymore. So no more cold feet, except for your wedding day maybe.\n\nKey pocket 2.0 - A key loop with mini buckle - An external neoprene key pocket conveniently positioned on the lower leg of the suit. The standard key loop is now equipped with a mini-buckle to release your key with ease while making sure your key is safe inside.\n\nBack knee emboss - Bending your knee has never been this easy.

The high stretch ratio and top-notch insulation will let you perform better and be more comfortable than ever.\n\nFlaremesh+ with Mystic's new Flaremesh+, once again they've united that holy trinity by making it a more geometrical pattern. Flaremesh+ still has a warm high pile, but we gave it a little trim to improve comfort even more. Flaremesh+ channels water through the fabric to decrease drying time dramatically.\n\nFox Fleece If it's soft, smooth and incredibly warm it's probably Mystic’s renewed Foxfleece thermal inner lining. Big loops in the fabric create a high pile lining that holds air for extra insulation. The fleece also holds less water enhancing the fast-drying abilities of the fabric.\n\nWaterproof stretch taping critical areas - A highly durable taping is used in the crucial areas of the suit to avoid leaking and keep it flexible and warm.\n\nGlued blind stitching is a method whereby the panels are first glued together and then only stitched halfway through the fabric instead of fully perforating it, which makes the seams waterproof.\n\nWind mesh has closed cell neoprene with one side of fabric lamination. The outside of the mesh neoprene offers a better protection against wind chill.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ",
