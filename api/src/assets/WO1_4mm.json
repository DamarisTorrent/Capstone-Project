    "description": "The Dazzled Bzip is one of our top-notch wetsuits for women and features a front zip closure. The Fox Fleece lining keeps your core and upper body nice and warm. This suit is constructed with our renowned 100% M-Flex 2.0 neoprene. A high-quality neoprene with superb stretch. All seams are glued blind stitched and have critical taping added to the most vulnerable seams around the waist.\n\nTHE DETAILS:\nWaterproof stretch taping (50%): critical areas - A neoprene taping is positioned on the critical seams of the suit. This prevents water from coming through the seams on critical points of the human body.\nGBS (Glued Blind Stitched) - Stitching method whereby the panels are first glued together and then only stitched halfway through the fabric instead of fully perforating it, which makes the seams waterproof.\nYKK Back-zip\nGlideskin neck construction\nOverhead backup shield\nHex-tech kneepads\nShin protection - Taking a rail to the shins isn't fun, but having EVA padding in our Shin Protection lowers the impact of your board by a ton.\nVelcro ankle closure straps (included)\nNon slip cuffs\nKey pocket 2.0: keyloop with mini buckle - An external neoprene key pocket conveniently positioned on the lower leg of the suit. The standard key loop is now equipped with a mini-buckle to release your key with ease while making sure your key is safe inside.\nAquaflush - Wipe out or simply needed to take a leak? The perforated neoprene patches on the lower leg, that we like to call Aquaflush, will ensure that all liquids exit the suit easily.\nMATERIALS:\nM-Flex (100%) - Now you've decided you're getting a kick out of the cold and wind, why not upgrade to M-Flex 100%? It'll keep you warm and also provides more stretch. Get ready for your next step and prepare well for the conditions you're about to face.\nFox fleece in chest, back and lower body - Big loops in the fabric create a high pile lining that holds air for extra insulation. It holds less water enhancing the fast-drying abilities of the fabric. With its superior stretch performance in all directions it’s super suitable for every panel in all of our suit.",
