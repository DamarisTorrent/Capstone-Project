    "description": "Cleanline Staff\nSophia Says:\n\n\"This suit stands up to the hype. It truly is the most flexible, comfortable suit on the market. The TBX3 technology is unmatched and feels smooth with every paddle. I feel like I don’t miss a beat in this wetsuit and have more technical ability when I’m surfing. If you’re looking for maximum flexibility in a 5/4 suit, this is it.\"\n\nThe O'Neill Women's Hyperfreak 5.5/4+ Chest Zip Hooded Wetsuit is the most performance-oriented wetsuit made for women. The suit is constructed with super light TechnoButter 3 in the legs and torso and TB3X neoprene in the arms and shoulders. This allows for maximum paddle ability and minimal weight, two critical factors concerning cold water wetsuits. The minimal seam design, overall lightweight, quality construction, and attention to detail make this a favorite among women who love surfing in cold water.\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\nThickness: 5.5/4+mm\nFull Body/Legs: TechnoButter 3\nArms/Shoulders: TechnoButter 3X\nSleeves: Long\nZipper: Chest Zip\nHood: Attached\nModel Year: 2021/2022\nManufacturers Part Number: 5478\nPRODUCT FEATURES\nF.U.Z.E. Closure\nMinimal Seam Design\n360° Barrier with Drain Holes\nTB3X Fully Taped Seams\nGlued and Blind Stitched Seams\nPLUS (+) = 0.5mm Extra thickness for even more warmth\nAqua Alpha Solvent Free Neoprene Lamination\nADDITIONAL INFO\n\nO'Neill uses recycled ocean oyster shells in place of calcium carbonate powder which comprises approximately 10% of their neoprene. O’Neill worked with their key manufacturing partner to develop a non-solvent based lamination glue called “aqua-alpha”. Aqua alpha reduces solvent usage by 600 grams per wetsuit compared to traditional laminating glues. Eliminates harmful VOCs and has the same durability as conventional, solvent-based Wetsuit glues. From recycled polybags to 100% recycled paper and soy based inks hang tags. Conserving water, energy and virgin materials. 100% digital catalogs. Dope-dying infusion produces colored yarns without the dyeing process. This saves tremendous amounts of water while reducing energy consumption and water pollution (up to 80%). 26% carbon emission is reduced for every kg of fabric. Carbon black is one of the key ingredients in neoprene. It can now be carbonized from scrap rubber tires using high heat to extract. 72% carbon emission declined. O’Neill’s advanced repair facility prolongs the life cycle of their product, keeping their wetsuit out of the landfill longer.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT CONSTRUCTION\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 3\nO’Neill’s exclusive, maximum stretch, hydrophobic neoprene with featherlight ENVY foam rubber core. Ultimate warmth and comfort. Built to last.\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 3X\nO’Neill’s exclusive new pre-stretched neoprene with featherlight, ENVY foam rubber core. The lightest, most flexible, softest material ever created. Superior flexibility and fit.\n\n\n\nMANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION\n\nThe HyperFreak F.U.Z.E. (Chest Zip) is constructed with super light TechnoButter 3 and TB3X neoprene. The minimal seam design, lightweight, quality construction, and attention to detail make this another team inspired favorite.\n\n\n\nVIDEO\n\n\n\n",

    "description": "Stay psyched with the O'Neill Women’s Psycho Tech 5.5/4+ Hooded Chest Zip Wetsuit. The women's Psycho Tech 5.5/4 hooded wetsuit ultimately focuses on warmth and durability. The sustainable TB4 Firewall technology from O’Neill retains and recirculates heat. O’Neill uses recycled ocean oyster shells and Aqua Alpha Solvent Free Neoprene Lamination to help reduce product emissions. The Psycho Tech is O’Neill’s premier wetsuit and is loved by enthusiasts for its high-performance technology.\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\nThickness: 5.5/4mm+\nChest / Back: TB4 Duraskin Air Firewall\nThigh / Butt / Shins / Calf: TB4 Firewall\nArms / Shoulders: TechnoButter 4\nEntry: TechnoButter 4X\nEntry System / Zipper: Chest Zip\nHood: Attached\nModel Year: 2022/2023\nMPN: 5508\nPRODUCT FEATURES\nF.U.Z.E.

O’Neill worked with their key manufacturing partner to develop a non-solvent based lamination glue called “aqua-alpha”. Aqua alpha reduces solvent usage by 600 grams per wetsuit compared to traditional laminating glues. Eliminates harmful VOCs and has the same durability as conventional, solvent-based Wetsuit glues. From recycled polybags to 100% recycled paper and soy based inks hang tags. Conserving water, energy and virgin materials. 100% digital catalogs. Dope-dying infusion produces colored yarns without the dyeing process. This saves tremendous amounts of water while reducing energy consumption and water pollution (up to 80%). 26% carbon emission is reduced for every kg of fabric. Every blueprint full suit saves more than 1 lb/0.5 kg of harmful plastic from potentially polluting the world’s living oceans. Carbon black is one of the key ingredients in neoprene. It can now be carbonized from scrap rubber tires using high heat to extract. 72% carbon emission declined. O’Neill’s advanced repair facility prolongs the life cycle of their product, keeping their wetsuit out of the landfill longer.\n\n\n\nPRODUCT CONSTRUCTION\n\nTB4 AIR FIREWALL\nThe next great thermal breakthrough was made better with trapped pockets of air. TB4 Air Firewall uses a special lamination process paired with a core of aerated neoprene and a graphene fiber jersey to create the toastiest conditions. Take summer with you.\n\nTB4 FIREWALL\nThe all new Technobutter 4 Firewall utilizes the recycled graphene fibers at a thicker pile to create a fire hot feedback loop. As the body heat warms the graphene fibers they conduct the heat back into the body.\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 4X\nTechnobutter 4x goes beyond the gooey stretch, and soft feel of TB3x. Recycled graphene fibers line the jersey allowing for incredible stretch with added strength and warmth retention, all with a new look.\n\nTECHNOBUTTER 4\nTB4 builds on the legendary Technobutter 3, the next evolution of the jersey introduces recycled yarns infused with graphene for increased wear strength and heat retention.\n\nMANUFACTURER’S DESCRIPTION\n\nO'Neill's Psycho Tech range focuses on ultimate warmth and durability with high-performance recycled materials and water-tight double-sealed stitchless seams. Sustainable TB4 Firewall technology radiates throughout with TB4 Duraskin Air Firewall in the chest and back to shield against the cold while retaining and recirculating your body heat. Designed to keep you in the water longer, toasty, and stoked.",
