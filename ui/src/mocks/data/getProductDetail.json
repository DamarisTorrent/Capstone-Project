  "description": "The O'Neill Women's Hyperfreak 3/2+ Chest Zip Wetsuit is a women's specific performance suit and is constructed from super light TechnoButter 3 and TBX neoprene to give you maximum stretch. O'Neill added 0.5 mm of extra neoprene to this model as a step-up from your normal 3/2. The seams are glued, blindstitched, and fully taped with TB3X tape to create an excellent barrier while maintaining your range of motion and flexibility. The Front Upper Zip Entry system uses a free-floating zipper panel and an anti-rash barrier with drain holes to keep you dry and feeling loose. The women's Hyperfreak has nice clean lines and a  flattering fit: a Cleanline Surf favorite amongst us ladies."
